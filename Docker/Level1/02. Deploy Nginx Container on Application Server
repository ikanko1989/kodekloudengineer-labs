Nautilus DevOps team is testing some applications deployment on some of the application servers. They need to deploy a nginx container on Application Server 3. Please complete the task as per details given below:
On Application Server 3 create a container named nginx_3 using image nginx with alpine tag and make sure container is in running state.

[root@stapp03 banner]# docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
