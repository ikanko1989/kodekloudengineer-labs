One of the Nautilus project developers created a container on App Server 2. This container was created for testing only and now we need to delete it. Accomplish this task as per details given below:
Delete a container named kke-container, its running on App Server 2 in Stratos DC.


Check the running containers.
[root@stapp02 ~]# docker ps -a
