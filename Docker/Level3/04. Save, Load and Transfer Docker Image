One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name cluster:datacenter. Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.
a. On App Server 1 save the image cluster:datacenter in an archive.
b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.
c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1.
Note: Docker is already installed on both servers; however, if its service is down please make sure to start it.
