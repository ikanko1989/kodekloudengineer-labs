The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to create few jobs in Kubernetes cluster. They might come up with some real scripts/commands to use, but for now they are preparing the templates and testing the jobs with dummy commands. Please create a job template as per details given below:
Create a job countdown-nautilus.
The spec template should be named as countdown-nautilus (under metadata), and the container should be named as container-countdown-nautilus
Use image ubuntu with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e ubuntu:latest, and restart policy should be Never.
Use command:
for i in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one ; do echo $i ; done 
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.



$ kubectl get all 

NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   111m

Create the manifest for the resource definitions based on the requirements.
