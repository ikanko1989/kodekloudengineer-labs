The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to deploy some micro services on Kubernetes platform. The team has already set up a Kubernetes cluster and now they want set up some namespaces, deployments etc. Based on the current requirements, the team has shared some details as below:
Create a namespace named dev and create a POD under it; name the pod dev-nginx-pod and use nginx image with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e nginx:latest.
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

nginx.yml:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dev-nginx-pod
  namespace: dev
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest

kubectl apply -f nginx.yml

thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl get ns
NAME                 STATUS   AGE
default              Active   5m24s
dev                  Active   90s
kube-node-lease      Active   5m25s
kube-public          Active   5m25s
kube-system          Active   5m25s
local-path-storage   Active   5m15s


thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl get all -n dev
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/dev-nginx-pod   1/1     Running   0          97s
thor@jump_host ~$ 
thor@jump_host ~$ kubectl describe -n dev pod dev-nginx-pod | grep Image:
