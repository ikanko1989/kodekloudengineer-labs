We already have a deployment named nginx-deployment and service named nginx-service. Some changes need to be made in this deployment and service, make sure not to delete the deployment and service.
1.) Change the service nodeport from 30008 to 32165
2.) Change the replicas count from 1 to 5
3.) Change the image from nginx:1.17 to nginx:latest

kubectl edit deployments.apps nginx-deployment 
spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:latest

kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=5
kubectl edit svc nginx-service 
 ports:
  - nodePort: 32165
