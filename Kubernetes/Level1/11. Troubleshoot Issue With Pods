One of the junior DevOps team members was working on to deploy a stack on Kubernetes cluster. Somehow the pod is not coming up and its failing with some errors. We need to fix this as soon as possible. Please look into it.

There is a pod named webserver and the container under it is named as httpd-container. It is using image httpd:latest

There is a sidecar container as well named sidecar-container which is using ubuntu:latest image.

Look into the issue and fix it, make sure pod is in running state and you are able to access the app.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.




$ kubectl get pods

webserver   1/2     ImagePullBackOff   0          89s 


Describe the pod. From here we can see a warning that tells us about a typo error in the name of the image used. This is what we need to correct.
$ kubectl describe pods

Generate a YAML file for the pod.
kubectl get pods -o yaml > pod.yaml 
Edit the spec file and ensure that the httpd container is using the correct image and tag.

    containerStatuses:
    - image: httpd:latests
Delete the resource first and apply.

kubectl delete -f pod.yaml 
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml 
$ kubectl get pods 

NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
