The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /opt/games.git which is cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos  directory present on Storage server in Stratos DC. The team want to setup a hook on this repository, please find below more details:
	• Merge the feature branch into the master branch`, but before pushing your changes complete below point.
	• Create a post-update hook in this git repository so that whenever any changes are pushed to the master branch, it creates a release tag with name release-2023-06-15, where 2023-06-15 is supposed to be the current date. For example if today is 20th June, 2023 then the release tag must be release-2023-06-20. Make sure you test the hook at least once and create a release tag for today's release.
	• Finally remember to push your changes.
