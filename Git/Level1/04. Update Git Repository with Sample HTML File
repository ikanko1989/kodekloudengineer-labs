4.The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repositories /opt/apps.git was created recently. 
The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp directory. 
The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. 
Copy sample index.html file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps, further add/commit the file and push to the master branch.
