The devops team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on to setup centralised logging management system to maintain and analyse server logs easily. 
Since it will take some time to implement, they wanted to gather some server logs on a regular basis. At least one of the app servers is having issues with the Apache server. 
The team needs Apache logs so that they can identify and troubleshoot the issues easily if they arise. So they decided to create a Jenkins job to collect logs from the server. 
Please create/configure a Jenkins job as per details mentioned below:


Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username admin and password Adm!n321
1. Create a Jenkins jobs named copy-logs.
2. Configure it to periodically build every 8 minutes to copy the Apache logs (both access_log and error_logs) from App Server 2 (from default logs location) to location /usr/src/itadmin on Storage Server.

Note:

1. You might need to install some plugins and restart Jenkins service. So, we recommend clicking on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre. Also, Jenkins UI sometimes gets stuck when Jenkins service restarts in the back end. In this case please make sure to refresh the UI page.
2. Please make sure to define you cron expression like this */10 * * * * (this is just an example to run job every 10 minutes).
3. For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.

JENKINS SERVER--->APP2 SERVER(scp Apache logs to)-->STORAGE SERVER

0)Login to APP2 server,generate keys and copy generated pub key to Storage server authorized_keys: 
thor@jumphost ~$ ssh steve@stapp02
ssh steve@stapp02's password: 
Last login: Wed Feb  5 10:31:13 2025 from 172.16.239.3

[steve@stapp02 ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
[steve@stapp02 ~]$ ssh-copy-id natasha@ststor01

Now should be able to login from APP2 server to Storage server without pass:
[steve@stapp02 ~]$ ssh natasha@ststor01
[natasha@ststor01 itadmin]$ pwd
/usr/src/itadmin
[natasha@ststor01 itadmin]$ ls

1)Go to Manage Jenkins/Plugins/Available plugins/ and install "Git" and "SSH,SSH Credentials,SSH Build Agents "plugins with selected option "Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running"

2)Go to Manage Jenkins/Credentials/Domains(Global)/+Add Credentials(UN:steve,Pass:Am3ric@,ID:APP2server)

3)Go to Manage Jenkins/Configure System/SSH remote hosts/Hostname:stapp02,Port:22,Credentials:steve,Check Connection/Save

4)Clicking New Item from the Jenkins dashboard,select "Freestyle Job", and then giving the item a name "copy-logs"

5)Click on created "copy-logs" job and:
Configure/Add Build Steps/Execute shell on remote host using ssh/SSH site:steve@stapp02:22/Command:scp /var/log/httpd/* natasha@ststor01:/usr/src/itadmin/
Configure/Build Triggers/Build periodically/ */8 * * * * and Save

6)Click on created "copy-logs" job and Build now
Jenkins Console Output:
